# Slicer-Featurelets-Extension

The content of the repository is an extension, containing one module, of 3D Slicer.
The model can be used for deformable image registration.

The ,,Featurelets-Registration'' module was developed as a Master Thesis at AKH Vienna under supervision of Univ.-Prof. Dietmar Georg and Hugo Furtado.
The idea of the Featurelet algorithm is based on Soehn, M. et al. (2008). The ,,Featurelets-Registration'' module is an implementation of the algorithm developed by Fabri, D. et al. (2014).
